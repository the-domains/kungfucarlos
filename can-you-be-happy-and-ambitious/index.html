It was a question that brought up some interesting discussions and debate and I’ll try to summarise what I got out of it.</b></p><p>Answering this question depends on how you define the words “happy” and “ambitious”. If you define “being happy” as a “state of contentment” and ambition as “the pursuit of wealth and/or fame” then the easy answer to this question would be “NO”. Logically, if you’re happy with your lot then why would you want to strive for more? In the startup world if you’re not looking to build the next billion dollar company then you’re not ambitious. Happiness and ambition just don’t mix!</p><p>However, when I think of happiness and ambition I don’t think of the “rat racer” who sacrifices today in order to be happy tomorrow. I think of how can you define happiness and ambition in such a way that they work together.</p><blockquote>Happiness is about finding meaning IN life,<br>even if you can’t find the meaning OF life</blockquote><h3>What is happiness?</h3><p>I would argue that being happy is living true to your values and living with a purpose (beyond making money).<a href="http://www.actionforhappiness.org/" data-href="http://www.actionforhappiness.org/">Action for Happiness</a>(a movement committed to promoting happiness in society) have a list of<a href="http://www.actionforhappiness.org/10-keys-to-happier-living/be-part-of-something-bigger" data-href="http://www.actionforhappiness.org/10-keys-to-happier-living/be-part-of-something-bigger">10 keys to happier living</a>. One of these keys is “<a href="http://www.actionforhappiness.org/10-keys-to-happier-living/be-part-of-something-bigger" data-href="http://www.actionforhappiness.org/10-keys-to-happier-living/be-part-of-something-bigger">meaning</a>”. By being connected to something that is bigger than yourself you create more focus in your life. This “bigger thing” is different for everyone but it acts as a true north and should give context to everything you do. Knowing that you’re living your higher purpose will make you happier, even during times of struggle and uncertainty. Knowing that you’re NOT sacrificing what’s important to you will make you happier.</p><blockquote>“It’s not about the money, money, money”</blockquote><h3>Ambition Redefined</h3><p>Most people associate ambition with sacrifice. They think of it as doing everything they can to achieve a goal no matter what that means. And while this makes sense (to succeed involves hard work and effort) an important part of ambition is understanding what success means to you. When success is measured in terms of the accumulation of money, material goods and fame then the things you may end up sacrificing are your relationships, your health and your integrity. In this case I can’t see how someone could be happy and ambitious.</p><p>However, if your success is based on making a positive impact on the world while living with integrity and compassion then I can see happiness and ambition going hand in hand. This doesn’t mean we can’t be running highly successful businesses while still being happy but it does mean we need to understand the motivation behind making these businesses successful.</p><p>At the Happy Startup School one of our ambitions is to make a global impact without having to scale the size of the company. We don’t want to turn into a faceless hierarchical corporate machine churning out valueless consumables to line our pockets. We want to help as many people as we can while keeping a close knit happy team. Some would say that’s very ambitious. Good. Because we are. But we’re also trying to be happy with it!</p><p>Ambition and happiness don’t need to be mutually exclusive. You just need to work out what ambition and happiness means to you. Personally I think if we linked our ambitions with the ambitions of others, and looked to help others rather than just trying to help ourselves then I think business wouldn’t have such a bad rep. If you wanted an example of how ambition and happiness can live together check out Treehouse’s video about their 32-hour workweek below.</p><p>If you want to work out how to stay happy while being ambitious.
